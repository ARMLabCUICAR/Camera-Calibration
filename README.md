# Camera Calibration
<b>Authors:</b> Tanmay Samak and Chinmay Samak

### Objectives:
* Calibrate the camera to get its intrinsic parameters.

### Theory:
Camera calibration computes the following parameters:
* Distortion coefficients
* Camera Intrinsic Parameters
    * Focal length
    * Optical centers
* Camera Extrinsic Parameters
    * Rotation vector
    * Translation vector

Following is a brief description of the process [1].
